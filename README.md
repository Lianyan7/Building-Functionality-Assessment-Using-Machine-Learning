# Building Functionality Assessment Using Machine-Learning

Supplemental Materials for the Paper "Assessing the Loss of Building Functionality Post-Earthquake Using Machine Learning"

This repository contains the Python code and supplementary materials for a novel computational framework designed to evaluate earthquake-induced loss of building functionality. The code was developed by **Lianyan Li**. Due to the sensitive nature of the data (which includes private property information), only the code and supporting documentation are publicly available.
