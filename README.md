# Building Functionality Assessment Using Machine-Learning
Supplemental Materials for the Paper ___"Assessing the Loss of Building Functionality Post-Earthquake Using Machine Learning"___
 
This repository provides the Python code underlying a novel computational framework designed to evaluate earthquake-induced loss of building functionality. The code was developed by Lianyan Li. Due to the sensitive nature of the data, which includes private property information, only the Python code is publicly available.

This repository contains four Python files:

- **Random Forest.py** and **Multilayer Perceptron.py** implement Random Forest (RF) and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) classifiers, respectively, with hyperparameter tuning and 10-fold cross-validation.
- **Feature Importance Analysis_RF.py** performs a detailed analysis of feature importances using the optimal RF model for functionality assessment.
- **Damage Propagation Pathway_RF.py** conducts an analysis of damage propagation pathways using the RF model.

These materials are intended for academic and professional use, contributing to the advancement of rapid post-earthquake functionality assessment methodologies.
